# Advent of Code
Join me in my journey to learning C programming with Advent of Code :) Nested folders of each day will contain README files that provides a brief overview of the thought process in solving the puzzles

## TODO
- reduce hardcoded values as much as possible
- improve code readability where it applies - more functions for reusable logic
- improve header files and imports
- write more comments in the code 
- brief overview of each solution
